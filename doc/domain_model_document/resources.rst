Resources

Resources should be anything that can or should be traded and tracked between facilities, institutions, and regions. These might be people, money, electricity, building materials, or fuel materials.

To serve use cases in which economics is a driver or important fuel cycle analysis metric, resources such as money, electricity, building materials, and workers will be essential to transport, track, and conserve.

For use cases in which environmental and health metrics are of interest, the transport, tracking, and conservation of fuel materials is paramount. 

Each of these categories should constitute its own resource class in Cyclus. A single Resource Type (e.g. people) might have many sub-types which may not be interchangeable. These subtypes will be dependent on quality and quantity checks provided for the class.
