Metrics
=========

A range of users are interested in a range of fuel cycle outcomes and metrics. 
A number of efforts to identify standard fuel cycle metrics have been conducted 
in the nuclear fuel cycle simulation community [METRICS2011]. These have 
included metrics in a few categories, namely : 

*  Safety
*  Environmental Impact
*  Economics
*  Proliferation

Units of measure for each of these aspects of nuclear energy vary from user to 
user. Though some units of measure are best derived with myriad pieces of information, 
many units of measure can be derived from two primary units of information, 

*  m_i(p,t) - the mass of an isotope i, at position p, and time t, and 
*  C_f(t) - the capacity factor at time, t.


Safety
--------

Example Units of Measure
************************

Safety might be measured in 

*  All cause nuclear related deaths 
   * per kilowatt
   * per year
*  Likely dose to Public
   * Sv, etc.
*  Core failure probability, etc.

Envrionmental Impact
---------------------

Example Units of Measure
*************************

Environmental Impact might be measured in 

*  Environmental release
   * curies
*  Repository space 
   * number of Yucca Mountains [#]
   * repository footprint [m^2]
   * repository volume [m^3]

Example Units of Measure
*************************

Economics might be measured in 

*  Levelized Cost of Electricity
   *  $
   *  $/kWh
*  Maximum capital at risk
   *  $
   *  $/kWh
*  Resource Utilization
   *  time to consumption
   *  Uranium Used / Uranium Avaialble
*  Energy Security?

Proliferation
-----------


Example Units of Measure
*************************

*  SQ (significant quantity) available in the system
   *  kg (a function of isotope)
*  Separated SQ 
   *  kg separated Pu
   *  kg enriched U
*  Loss factors
   *  kg
